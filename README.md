# Python Crash Course - Learning Repository

This repository contains my learning journey through "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. Each chapter folder contains practical examples and exercises that demonstrate the concepts covered in the book.

## 📚 Project Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of Python examples and exercises from the Python Crash Course book. Each chapter is organized into its own folder with multiple Python files demonstrating various concepts.



## 🚀 Projects

### [Project 1 - Alien Invasion Game](Project1/)

A complete 2D game built with Pygame, demonstrating:

- Game development concepts
- Object-oriented programming
- Event handling
- Graphics and animation

### [Project 2 - Data Visualization](Project2/)

Multiple data visualization projects including:

- **Dice/** - Rolling dice simulations
- **Earthquake/** - Mapping earthquake data
- **PlottingSquare/** - Matplotlib examples
- **RandomWalk/** - Random walk visualizations
- **Weather/** - Weather data analysis
- **Working_API/** - API integration examples

## 📋 How to Use This Repository

1. **Navigate to any chapter folder** to see the Python examples
2. **Run the Python files** to see the concepts in action:
   ```bash
   python Chapter01/101_hello_world.py
   ```
3. **Study the code** and experiment with modifications
4. **Check the [PDF notes](./python_crash_course_notes.pdf)** for detailed explanations

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This repository covers:

- ✅ Basic Python syntax and data types
- ✅ Control structures (if statements, loops)
