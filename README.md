# Python Crash Course - Learning Repository

This repository contains my learning journey through "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes. Each chapter folder contains practical examples and exercises that demonstrate the concepts covered in the book.

## üìö Project Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of Python examples and exercises from the Python Crash Course book. Each chapter is organized into its own folder with multiple Python files demonstrating various concepts.

## üöÄ Projects

### [Project 1 - Alien Invasion Game](Project1/)

A complete 2D game built with Pygame, demonstrating:

- Game development concepts
- Object-oriented programming
- Event handling
- Graphics and animation

### [Project 2 - Data Visualization](Project2/)

Multiple data visualization projects including:

- **Dice/** - Rolling dice simulations
- **Earthquake/** - Mapping earthquake data
- **PlottingSquare/** - Matplotlib examples
- **RandomWalk/** - Random walk visualizations
- **Weather/** - Weather data analysis
- **Working_API/** - API integration examples

### [Project 3 - Learning Log Web Application](Project3/)

A complete web application built with Django, demonstrating:

- **Web development** with Django framework
- **Database design** and models
- **User authentication** and authorization
- **Form handling** and data validation
- **Template system** and frontend design
- **Deployment** and hosting considerations
- **RESTful API** development
- **Security best practices** for web applications

## üìã How to Use This Repository

1. **Navigate to any chapter folder** to see the Python examples
2. **Run the Python files** to see the concepts in action:
   ```bash
   python Chapter01/101_hello_world.py
   ```
3. **Study the code** and experiment with modifications
4. **Check the [PDF notes](./python_crash_course_notes.pdf)** for detailed explanations

## üéØ Learning Objectives

This repository covers:

- ‚úÖ Basic Python syntax and data types
- ‚úÖ Control structures (if statements, loops)
- ‚úÖ Data structures (lists, dictionaries)
- ‚úÖ Functions and classes
- ‚úÖ File I/O and exception handling
- ‚úÖ Testing and debugging
- ‚úÖ Game development with Pygame
- ‚úÖ Data visualization with Matplotlib
- ‚úÖ Web development with Django

## üìù Notes

- Each Python file is self-contained and can be run independently
- Comments in the code explain the concepts being demonstrated
- The [PDF note](./python_crash_course_notes.pdf) file provide detailed theoretical explanations
- All examples follow Python best practices and PEP 8 style guidelines

## üîó Resources

- [Python Crash Course Book](./Python Crash Course.pdf)
- [Python Official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/)
- [PEP 8 Style Guide](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
