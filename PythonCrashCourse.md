# Chapter 1 - Getting Started

## Summary

1. Learn Python a bit in general
2. Installation of Python and text editor on system
3. Run snippets of Python code oin terminal session and first Python program
4. A bit on trouble shooting

## Questions

(P.13)

1. **python.org**
Explore the Python home page to find topics that interest you,
As you become familiar with Python, different parts of the site will be more useful to you.
[Python Home Page](https://python.org)

2. **Hello World Typos**
Open the hello_world.py file you just created.
Make a typo somewhere in the line and run the program again.
Can you make a typo that generates an error?
Can you make a typo that doesn't generate an error?
Why do you think it didn't make an error?

3. **Infinite Skills**
If you had infinite programming skills, what would you build?
You're about to learn how to program.
If you have an end goal in mind, you'll have an immediate use for your new skills; now is a great time to draft descriptions of what you want to create.
It's a good habit to keep an "ideas" notebook that you can refer to whenever you want to start a new project.
Take a few minutes now to describe three programs you want to create.

# Chapter 2 - Variable and Simple Data Types

## Summary

1. Working with variables
  * Use descriptive variable names
  * Resolve name errors and syntax errors
2. What strings are
  * Display strings using lowercae, uppercase and title case
3. Use whitespace to organise outputs
  * Strip unneeded whitespaces from different parts of a string
4. Working with integers and floats
  * Some of the ways that able to work with numerical data
5. Write explanatory comments to make code easiler to read
6. Philiposophy of keeping code as simple as possible

## Questions

(P.19)

Write a separate program to accomplish each of these exercises.
Save each program with a filename that follows standard Python conventions, using lowercase letters and underscores, such as `simple_message.py` and `simple_messages.py`.

1. **Simple Message**
Assign a message to a variable, and then print that message.

2. **Simple Messages**
Assign a message to a variable, and print that message.
Then change the value of the variable to a new message, and print the new messages.

(P.25)

Save each of the following exercises as a separate file with a name like name_cases.py.
If you get stuck, take a break of see the suggestions in Appendix C.

3. **Personal Message**
Use a variable to represent a person's name, and print a message to that person.
Your message should be simple, such as "Hello Eric, would you like to learn some Python today?"

4. **Name Causes**
Use a variable to represent a person's name, and the print that person's name in lowercase, uppercase and title case.

5. **Famous Quote**
Find a quote from a famous person you admire.
Print the quote and the name of its author.
Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks:

```
Albert Einstein once said, "A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new."
```

6. **Famous Quote 2**
Repeat Exercise 2.5, but this time, represent the famous person's name using a variable called famous_person.
Then compose your messsage and represent it with a new variable called message.
Print your message.

7. **Stripping Names**
Use a variable to represent a person's name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name.
Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n" at least once.
Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
Then print the name using each of the three stripping function, `lstrip()`, `rstrip()` and `strip()`.

(P.29)

8. **Number Eight:**
Write addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operators that each result in the number 8.
Be sure to enclose your operations in pirnt() calls to see the results.
You should create four lines that look like this:
```
print(5+3)
```
Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.

9. **Favourite Number**
Use a variable to represent your favourite number.
Then using that variable, create a message that reveals your favourite number.
Print that message.

(P. 30)

10. **Adding Comments**
Choose two of the programs you've written and add at least one comment to each.
If you don't have anyting specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the customer date at the top of each program file.
Then write one sentence descripting what the program does.

(P. 31)

11. **Zen of Python**
Enter `import this` into a Python terminal session and skim though the additional principles.
